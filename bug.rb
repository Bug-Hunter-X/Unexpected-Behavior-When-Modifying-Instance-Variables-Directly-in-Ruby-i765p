```ruby
class MyClass
  def initialize(value)
    @value = value
  end

  def value
    @value
  end
end

my_instance = MyClass.new(10)
puts my_instance.value # => 10

#Problem: Unexpected behavior when modifying the instance variable directly.
my_instance.instance_variable_set(:@value, 20)
puts my_instance.value # => 20

#The accessor method does not reflect changes made directly to the instance variable.
#This is because the instance variable is not being updated through the accessor method.
